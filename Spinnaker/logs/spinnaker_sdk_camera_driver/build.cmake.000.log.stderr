[33m[1mCMake Warning[0m at /home/stereo/newspin_ws/src/spinnaker_camera_driver/CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findtrigger_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "trigger_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "trigger_msgs" with
  any of the following names:

    trigger_msgsConfig.cmake
    trigger_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "trigger_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "trigger_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "trigger_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
